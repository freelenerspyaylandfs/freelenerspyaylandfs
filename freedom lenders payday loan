Smith intended to have one night of fun when he downloaded EarnIn, but he worked unpredictable hours at the time so he also got advances to bridge income gaps.

When he was most reliant on cash advance apps, Smith says, most of his paycheck would be gone from his bank account before he even saw it. Then, he had to claw back funds by taking advances from seven or eight apps — a cycle he repeated each pay period.

“It just went completely out of control, and I was having to live off the borrowing apps,” he says.

In August 2023, the Center for Responsible Lending reported its survey results showing that most users borrowed from an app one or two times per week in a typical month, and 24% of users borrowed from multiple apps regularly.

“I think that’s indicative that people are falling into a debt trap,” Kushner says. “They’re basically having to keep borrowing and paying these fees just to get back to where they were beforehand.”
