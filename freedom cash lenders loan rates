It’s possible to use a cash advance app without sliding into a debt cycle, says Brandy Baxter, a Dallas-area accredited financial counselor (AFC) who studies trends in financial services.

The key is to borrow money only when you know you can repay it, she says. But for people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, that’s easier said than done.

“When you’re an hourly employee, anything can happen between the day you took the loan and the day that it is due,” she says. “The mobile app is going to debit your account no matter what. They don’t care that you didn’t work the hours you thought you were going to work.”
